# Premium APIs

The Bitly API makes available some premium APIs to those who pay for the service. These APIs cover custom Bitlinks, Campaigns and QR codes.

As I ([@philnash](https://github.com/philnash)) do not have a premium account, I have not implemented them in this gem yet. I will happily accept pull requests from those who have access and know what a result will look like. Please raise an issue if you would like to help with this but need some guidance.
